Some notes:

This directory is where I built the stacks for the DoES version of the Verkstan.

I'm working on the premise of a 0.3mm layer height.

Please contact me if you need different stack amounts at sean.tomlinson@lstmed.ac.uk

The original DoES Verkstan was 5.029mm tall, this has been modified to be 5.4mm so that it's a whole multiple of the 0.3mm layer height. For the stacks to work both the layer height and initial layer height need to be 0.3mm

Some notes:

This directory is where I built the stacks for the DoES version of the Verkstan.

I'm working on the premise of a 0.3mm layer height.

Please contact me if you need different stack amounts at sean.tomlinson@lstmed.ac.uk if you are unable to modify the included Fusion360 file.

Height of model: 5.029mm
Spacing: 1 layer (0.3mm)
Software used: Fusion360

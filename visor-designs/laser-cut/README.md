# Laser-cut Face Shield/Visor Design Files

A place for any design files suited for production with laser-cutters.

 * [visor-pp_4holePunchSpacing.dxf](visor-pp_4holePunchSpacing.dxf) - @amcewen's flat-packed design inspired by the Prusa 3D printed design.  Cut it in 0.8-1.5mm polypropylene and pair with an A4 OHP transparency punched with a standard Euro/UK 4-hole punch.
 
 
*  [Covid 19 Facemask - V0.4.dxf](Covid%2019%20Facemask%20-%20V0.4.dxf) - From Kitronik/NottingHack/Smoke and Mirrors) (https://community.andmirrors.co.uk/t/covid-19-laser-cut-face-shield/168)

* [hybrid_4holePunchSpacing.dxf](hybrid_4holePunchSpacing.dxf) - Hybrid adding the Covid 19 Facemask headstrap to the visor-pp design. Untested and likely to have undocumented features. Use the other two options for production.

Both designs have two versions with Prusa and four hole punch spacings for the tabs that hold the face piece. The Prusa standard appears to be more widely used and replacement shields should be available in this format. The four punch makes it easier for us to produce face shields with current tools, and also means hospitals can make replacements with office stationary. 

 * Prusa - spacing between holes 80mm , 60mm, 80mm
 * 4 punch - spacing between holes 80mm, 80mm, 80mm

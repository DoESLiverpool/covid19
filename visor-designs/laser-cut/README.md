# Laser-cut Face Shield/Visor Design Files

A place for any design files suited for production with laser-cutters.

 * [visor-pp_4holePunchSpacing.dxf](visor-pp_4holePunchSpacing.dxf) - @amcewen's flat-packed design inspired by the Prusa 3D printed design.  Cut it in 0.8-1.5mm polypropylene and pair with an A4 OHP transparency punched with a standard Euro/UK 4-hole punch.
 
*  [Covid 19 Facemask - V0.4.dxf](Covid%2019%20Facemask%20-%20V0.4.dxf) - From Kitronik/NottingHack/Smoke and Mirrors) (https://community.andmirrors.co.uk/t/covid-19-laser-cut-face-shield/168)

Both main designs have two versions with Prusa and four hole punch spacings for the tabs that hold the face piece. 
* The Prusa standard (80mm, 60mm, 80mm) appears to be more widely used and replacement shields should be available in this format. 
* The four punch (80mm, 80mm, 80mm) makes it easier for us to produce face shields with current tools, and also means hospitals can make replacements with office stationary. Smoke and Mirrors/Nottinghack have a process to produce the Prusa spacings from A4 sheets in this format using two hole punches.

## Hybrid

Versions that combine the two original designs

* Hybrid V1 **Current design

[hybrid_4holePunchSpacing.dxf](hybrid_4holePunchSpacing.dxf) - Hybrid adding the Covid 19 Facemask headstrap to the visor-pp design. This is the current prefered version as it doesn't require elastic.

[hybridV1x16_1100x650Sheet.dxf](hybridV1x16_1100x650Sheet.dxf) - 1100x650mm sheet layout for this design, yields 16 units.

[hybridV1x20_1100x650Sheet.dxf](hybridV1x20_1100x650Sheet.dxf) - 1100x650mm sheet layout for this design, yields 20 units.

* Hybrid V2 (dev)

[hybridV2_4holePunchSpacing.dxf](hybridV2_4holePunchSpacing.dxf) - Single piece version of the hybrid (~730mm) Tessellates when rotated 180deg so the cut path is significantly shorter for a batch.

[hybridV2x16_1100x650Sheet.dxf](hybridV2x16_1100x650Sheet.dxf) - A sheet layout for the V2 design based on 1100x650mm material, it yields 16 units per sheet. There is less waste than with V1 and because cut lines are shared it is much quicker to cut. Leaves an offcut of 350x650mm which is large enough for 4xV1 units.

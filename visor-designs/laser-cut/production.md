# Manufacturing laser cut visors at DoES

We have materials and designs to be able to produce laser cut visors to help protect workers at risk of infection from Covid-19. 

If you have time to offer to help manufacture these face shields at DoES please read the following carefully and then add your name to the slots you are able to cover in the spreadsheet.

There are three main parts to the manufacture;
* Laser cutting headbands
* Cleaning headbands with IPA
* Cutting face shields with scissors/hole punch

While making these masks is incredibly helpful to frontline staff we won’t be helping if we spread the infection. So while we appreciate all help it’s important that we keep numbers in the space to a minimum. 

Safety is the most important consideration and you should follow the guidance from DoES [https://doesliverpool.com/press-releases/does-liverpool-covid-19-plan/](https://doesliverpool.com/press-releases/does-liverpool-covid-19-plan/) 
If you are not a fob holder but can help speak to Jackie who can arrange a temporary fob for you.. 

To sign up block out the times you are able to offer and the task you will be coming in to help with.
**Please do not come to the space to help if you haven't booked a slot


# Roles

## Laser cutting 

The current design is saved to the desktop in ECP format as hybridV1x20_1100x650Sheet.ecp
This file has all the cut settings just open it up and cut.

Place all offcuts in the clear bags for future recycling

After you have finished cutting clean the machine (instructions?)

To help us keep track of materials used record what you use here (?)



## Face shields

Cut the visors. Some of our material is on rolls and will need cutting to size, The larger guillotine is set up to cut 210mm strips, they can then be sliced with the smaller cutter to 300mm to produce sheets.

Then use the four hole punch to centrally along the long side

Opposite the holes round off the corners with scissors.

Pack in labelled bags with the date in quantities of 20 per bag

Once complete, stack bags on the table in the back office (?) and record the quantity produced on this spreadsheet and update the materials list to reflect what you used.

## Clean the headband parts
Use the spray bottle to apply a little IPA to the stained areas and run clean with a sponge. This process is cosmetic rather than to sterilize at this stage. Bundle in sets of 20s labelled with the date.

Stack on the table in the back office and record the number of units here (?)

## How to get involved

If you’re a newcomer looking to volunteer, stop reading this document, and [fill in this form instead](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca6bWcUwvAfzfc2A-vNTZklxa5KxeChzk6gO2pMnESX3pfCg/viewform).

Once you’ve submitted the form, we’ll be in touch with you, to organise a time for you to come in for your onboarding.

If you are unable to travel or would prefer to work from home, email [covid@doesliverpool.com](mailto:covid@doesliverpool.com), and we’ll discuss tasks you can do from home.

The rest of this document explains how to do everything you’ll need to do as a volunteer, once you’ve [filled in our volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca6bWcUwvAfzfc2A-vNTZklxa5KxeChzk6gO2pMnESX3pfCg/viewform) and been onboarded as a new volunteer.

## Booking a production slot

While we appreciate all help, it is important that we keep numbers in the space to a minimum.

At your onboarding, we’ll show you how to block out the times you intend to be here, on our spreadsheet:

[Production slots spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nn2kCCu9TOgxJlUh01Y-L10jXJNEoijAkrV9hTZMpOo/edit?usp=sharing)

If your plans change after booking a slot, and you can no longer make it, please un-book your slot by removing your name from the spreadsheet.

## ⚠️ DO NOT ATTEND IF YOU ARE FEELING UNWELL

Especially if you have a temperature or a new persistent cough.  If that is the case you should fully self isolate as per government guidelines [(link)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/self-isolation-advice/) and inform us so that we can inform others working in the space, quarantine any stock you worked on and notify recipients if necessary.

While making these masks is incredibly helpful to frontline staff we won’t be helping if we spread the infection.

## Preventing contamination in the space
We have split the space into three zones. Those that don’t know the space will be shown round:

* *The Events room.* This is the area where contamination procedures are less strict. It’s where items brought into the space from outside can live. If you need to work on your laptop, this room is probably the best place for that.
* *The area just inside the main door and the kitchen.* We want to minimise any risk of contamination in this area. People will need to use it to go to wash their hands.
* *Everywhere else in the main space (including Dinky, Room29, the CNC room and the toilets).* This is a controlled zone. You should wash your hands before entering this area.  Only essential items should be taken into this space, and they should be cleaned beforehand (using wipes or cleaning spray and a paper towel)

## When you arrive 
Our address: 

```
DoES Liverpool
1st Floor, The Tapestry
68-76 Kempston Street
Liverpool 
L3 8HL
```

### Upon arrival: 
1. Leave your bike and any bags and coats in the area by the safe in the Events room.
2. Check in online using the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nn2kCCu9TOgxJlUh01Y-L10jXJNEoijAkrV9hTZMpOo/edit#gid=1319346095)
2. Then wash your hands.
3. You should keep a distance of at least `2m` between you and other users of the space.

*Please remember* 
* It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that the space is kept as clean as possible
* Please wipe down all surfaces before and after use, as well as other areas such as the fridge door handle.  
* Surface cleaning spray is available by the workshop sink in the kitchen. 
* The space will still be cleaned as usual, this is an additional precaution.

## Roles
There are three main parts to the manufacturing process:
1. Laser cutting headbands
2. Cleaning headbands
3. Cutting face shields with scissors/hole punch

### (1) Laser cutting headbands  

The current design is saved to the desktop in ECP format as `C:\desktop\hybridV1_20.ecp` – This file has all the cut settings, just open it up and cut. Currently the LaserCut50.exe software in C:\LaserCut50 doesn't work. Please use the icon towards the right hand side of the desktop which will open the version in C:\LaserCut50 - Copy instead.

Sometimes the laser settings change. They should be: Speed 65 and Power 50 for cuts, Speed 65 and Power 20 for engraving. The settings are entered on the computer Lasercut software - do not change the settings. The LCD screen on the laser cutter machine also shows Power and Speed but these can be ignore

This results in a cut time of about 20 minutes for 20 units, excluding loading and unloading.

To speed up production, as soon as a sheet is cut, remove it and any left-over parts from the laser bed, replace a new sheet into the cutter, start cutting, and then, while the new sheet is cutting, you can take your time disconnecting parts from the old sheet.

Sheets of fresh polypropylene are stored on top of Monty (the massive laser-cutter). More is available in the yard if stock needs to be replenished.

Put cut headbands into the crate also on top of Monty. At the end of your shift, or when the crate is full, transfer the headbands to the *Cleaning Station*.

After you have finished cutting, clean the machine. Vacuum clean the bed, and the base of the machine (under the bed). Remove the filter from the filter box next to the fan on the far wall, vacuum it clean, and then place it back into the filter box.

Cut offcuts into strips and place in the clear bags for future recycling.

If there are any problems with the laser-cutter or it stops cutting properly, [raise a new issue](https://github.com/DoESLiverpool/somebody-should/issues/new/choose) for us to investigate.

#### Tricks and tips

* I have the blocks at the edge of the sheet to make it easy to slot the new sheet in and it'll be positioned right. I don't seem to need to have anything on top of the sheet for good cuts

### (2) Cleaning the headband parts  

This is done at the *Cleaning Station*, in the nook.

Use the spray bottle to apply a little IPA to the stained areas and run clean with a sponge. This process is cosmetic rather than to sterilise at this stage.

Collect them together in sets of 20 and place them into a plastic bag labelled with the packing date, your initials, name and version of visor, and DoES Liverpool.

Stack on the table in the back office (Room 29).

### (3) Cutting the clear plastic face shields

The equipment and materials for this are arranged on the workshop benches.

Cut the clear plastic shields for the visors.

Some of our material is on rolls and will need cutting to size. The larger guillotine is set up to cut 210mm strips, they can then be sliced with the smaller cutter to 300mm to produce sheets.

Some of our material is pre-cut to A3 sheets. These should be cut in half using the smaller guillotine to make them A4.

Then use the four hole punch to centrally along the long side.

Opposite the holes round off the corners with scissors.

Pack in labelled bags with the date in quantities of 20 per bag.

Once complete, stack bags on the table in the back office (Room 29).
